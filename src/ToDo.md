- App pages template - 1/page
- JS, HTML, CSS, next steps
  -shortcut for list with [x]

* \*\* Responsiveness: scroll through profile into about and expereince

global import of profile - picture, facts, etc.

\*\* FUN: Wes Bos Course - check out module 7, session 40: turtle CSS. Could be fun to include a similar kind of game on projects page. People could navigate with cursor or choose "animal" and have some fun?

** MAP **

// TODO:
// Function: check users location - find out [x] and add information to the popup [ ]
// Change text inside popup depending if location has been found or not [ ]
